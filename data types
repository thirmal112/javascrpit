DATA TYPES:
Dynamic type language
Two types:
1)primitive data types: predefined  and it stores single values
	NUMBERS : integers,floats
	STRING: stream of characters enclosed in quotes(single,double,backtick quotes)
	BOOLEAN: true or false
	NULL: empty value or no value
	UNDEFINED: a declared value with no value
2)Non primitive data types: These are more complex types that refer to objects, classes, or arrays.
Objects,Arrays

1)CONDITION STATEMENTS: Condition statements are used to execute a block of code based on whether a specific condition is true or false. They are typically used for decision-making.
Examples of Condition Statements in Java:
•	if Statement: Executes a block if the condition is true.
•	Else: Executes a block if the condition is false.
•	else-if: 
•	switch Statement: Selects one of many blocks to execute based on a variable's value.
2) Loop Statements:
Loop statements are used to repeat a block of code multiple times as long as a specified condition is true. They are typically used for iteration.
Examples of Loop Statements in Java:
•	for Loop: Repeats code a specific number of times.
•	while Loop: Repeats code as long as the condition is true.
•	do-while Loop: Similar to a while loop, but ensures the block is executed at least once.
