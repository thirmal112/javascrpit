Methode:
	If
If(condition){
Block of code
}
  let a=4
        let b=5
        if(a<b){
            document.write("Hello","<br>")
        }
        document.write("Hi")

	If-else
    if(a>b){
            document.write("Hello","<br>")
        }
        else{
            document.write("Hi  ")
        }
        document.write("Thirmal")

	Else-if
let age=prompt("Enter age: ")
        let name=prompt("Enter name: ")
        if(age<18){
            alert(name+ " you are too young to marry")
        }
        else if(age>35){
            alert(name+ " you are too old to marry")
        }
        else{
            alert(name+ " perfect age to marry")
        }
        alert("welcome to my world")

Write a program that reads the score A and B of two players and checks if one of the scores is greater than 300 and sum of the scores is less than 500

function checkScores(A, B) {
              if ((A > 300 || B > 300) && (A + B < 500)) {
                 // console.log("can teamup");
                 alert ("can teamup");
              } else {
                  //console.log("cannot teamup");
                  alert ("canot teamup");
              }
          }
          
          const scoreA = parseInt(prompt("Enter Player A's score: "));
          const scoreB = parseInt(prompt("Enter Player B's score: "));
          
          checkScores(scoreA, scoreB);
